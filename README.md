# hepatica
*hepatica* is a progress tracking tool to satisfy my vanity :)

I've tried my best to make this project *forkable*. That being said it was/is developed for my personal use. There is currently no internal documentation.

If you use virtual environments for Python, now would be the time to make a new one :)

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
